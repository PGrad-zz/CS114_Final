Overarching idea:
	-Volumetric rendering by raymarching with SDFs
	-Properties of light
Bubbles:
	-Interference as a product of refraction/thin film interference
		-NOT DIFFRACTION, that describes bending of light
	-Reflection
	-Metaballs SDFs
Glass:
	-Raycasting individual wavelengths of light
	-Refraction
		-Snell's window
	-Dispersion
	-Reflection
